# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This is a command-line application that takes information (name, id, email, gitHub, office number and school) about employees in a team of software engineers and generates a HTML webpage based on the input information. Upon starting the application, a user is asked a series of questions relating to their job role. Once information for each employee has been entered, a HTML file is generated, where the input information is rendered onto a series of cards based on each employee.

Testing can be run for each new employee class that is created to ensure each part of the code is maintainable.
